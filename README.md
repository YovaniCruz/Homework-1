01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

Our task was to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible. An important rule was for us to follow when working with someone else's code was the Scout Rule:

> Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
## Made sure proper content sectioning and text content elements were used

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
## Made sure proper content sectioning was used

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
## Renamed the semantic HTML eliments to make it more identifyable

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
## Renamed the title specifically to the company


## In addition
CSS was cleaned up of any redundancies that were no longer needed
Footer was updated to render current year"2020" copywrite date
